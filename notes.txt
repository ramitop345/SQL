SQL: Structured Query Language
this is used for relational Data Bases
it is made of rows and columns and
every row has a unique id


the ID can be every thing that is unique for each row in the Database
it can be an Email, a Number, a SSN, or any other unique id to the items, it is called primary key

A FOREING kEY is a primary key from one table used in another table to define a relation bwtween the two tables.
this can be used to complete informations(columns) of a table in another table

Forein Keys can also be used in the same table to define relationships between the items

We also have COMPOSITE KEYS: these are tables with at least 2 (Primary)Keys. It works like a combination 



SQL is a combinaion of 4 different types of languages:
- DATA QUERY LANGUAGE(DQL): manipulate queries/entries 
-DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE(DDL): define entries
-DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE(DCL): control Permissions and restrictions
-DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE(DML): Insert und Update elements in Database


the QUERY is a set of instructions given to the DBMS to retrieve specific data
